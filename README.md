# Spinnable.js

## Introduction

> Simple spinners in vanilla JS, and HTML.  I found that creating a spinner was annoying because of how much trigonometry was necessary, so I created this to ease of the pain of anyone else who may want to user a spinner for whatever reason. Is it necessary? Who knows?


## Code Samples

Getting started is easy. Check it out:

```javascript
let el = document.getElementById('my-spinner'); 

let options = { data: [1, 2, 3'], colors: ['red', 'blue', green']};

let spinner = new Spinnable(el, options);
```
Done.
